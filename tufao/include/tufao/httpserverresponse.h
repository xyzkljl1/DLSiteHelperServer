  The Tufao::HttpServerResponse is used to respond to a

  A response is built of well defined parts and must be sent ordered. The order

    - Status line: Tufao::HttpServerResponse::writeHead
    - Headers: Set them with Tufao::HttpServerResponse::headers and they will be
      automatically flushed when the first piece of body is written.
    - Message body: Use Tufao::HttpServerResponse::write or
      Tufao::HttpServerResponse::end
    - Trailers (optional): Use Tufao::HttpServerResponse::addTrailers
    - EOF: Use Tufao::HttpServerResponse::end

  \note
  In HTTP/1.0 connections, it's not possible to send the message body in chunks
  and you must use Tufao::HttpServerResponse::end to send the full body at once.
  Additionally, HTTP/1.0 connections don't support trailers too.
