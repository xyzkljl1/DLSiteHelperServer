  The Tufao::AbstractMessageSocket class represents a socket that sends and
  receives messages.

  Classes implementing Tufao::AbstractMessageSocket can provide several high
  level functionalities, such as:
    - Messages separation and interleaving
    - Messages compression
    - Authentication
    - Proxy or tunnel
    - ...

  It's main purpose is to allow easily change the message exchange mechanism in
  algorithms that depends on message passing. You could use it, for example, to
  allow a class that provide a RPC mechanism to work on different connections
  types.
