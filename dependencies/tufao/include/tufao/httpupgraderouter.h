/*!
  This class provides a robust and high performance HTTP request router. It
  allows to register a chain of upgrade handlers. This router uses mapping rules
  based on the url's path component to determine the correct handlers.

  The type of mapping rules used in this class provides a predictable behaviour
  that is simple to understand and allow the use of caching algorithms to
  improve the performance.

  When the router finds one matching request handler, it will call it. If the
  found handler cannot handle the request (this is indicated by the return
  value), the router will continue its quest in the search of a worthy handler.
  If the router fails in its quest (when no handlers are found or when none of
  the found handlers are able to respond the request), the handleRequest method
  in the router returns false and the connection remains open.

  The code below provides an example usage:

  \include httpupgraderouter.cpp

  \sa
  HttpServer::setUpgradeHandler

      It will route the request to the right handler.

      The handler will have access to the list of captured texts by the regular
      expression using HttpServerRequest::customData.

      \note
      The router won't touch the HttpServerRequest::customData if the regex
      don't capture any text.

      See example below:

      \include custom_data.cpp

      If there is already an object set for this request, the router will do the
      following steps:

      1. If the object is not a QVariantMap, override it
      2. If the object already has a item with the key "args", but the value is
         not a QStringList, override the item
      3. Append the list of captured texts in the object["args"]

      \note
      The request's custom data is copied at the beginning and is used to
      restore the custom data state before call every handler. The state will
      also be restored if no handlers are capable of handle the request.

      \return
      Returns true if one handler able to respond the request is found.
