/*!
  This class provides a robust and high performance HTTP request router. It
  allows register a chain of request handlers. This router uses mapping rules
  based on the url's path component and http method to determine the correct
  handlers.

  The type of mapping rules used in this class provides a predictable behaviour
  that is simple to understand and allow the use of caching algorithms to
  improve the performance.

  When the router finds one matching request handler, it will call it passing
  the request and response objects. If the found handler cannot handle the
  request (this is indicated by the return value), the router will continue its
  quest in the search of a worthy handler. If the router fails in its quest
  (when no handlers are found or when none of the found handlers are able to
  respond the request), the handleRequest method in the router returns false and
  the connection remains open. This mean that you should always create a handler
  that responds to any request with a <i>404 not found</i> as the last handler
  in the most top-level request router.

  The code below provides an example usage:

      request. You can use this return value to overcome the simplistic nature
      of the provided filter or to respond requests partially (like fill headers

      The handler will have access to the list of captured texts by the regular
      expression using HttpServerRequest::customData.

      \note
      The router won't touch the HttpServerRequest::customData if the regex
      don't capture any text.

      See example below:

      \include custom_data.cpp

      If there is already an object set for this request, the router will do the
      following steps:

      1. If the object is not a QVariantMap, override it
      2. If the object already has a item with the key "args", but the value is
         not a QStringList, override the item
      3. Append the list of captured texts in the object["args"]

      \note
      The request's custom data is copied at the beginning and is used to
      restore the custom data state before call every handler. The state will
      also be restored if no handlers are capable of handle the request.

      \return
      Returns true if one handler able to respond the request is found.
